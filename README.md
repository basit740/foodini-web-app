### Foodini App
Everybody in Australia knows somebody with a food allergy intolerance or preference. The vegan co-worker, the coeliac cousin, the friend with a nut allergy. And dietary requirements have risen dramatically over the last decade and are continuing to do so. Foodini was created to solve a very simple but very important problem – where is it suitable for me to eat, and exactly what can I eat when I get there?

With Foodini, users can create a customised profile of their specific dietary requirements (31 different diets and allergens to choose from) and Foodini will then show them which restaurants have options for them, and an exact breakdown of what they can and can’t eat on each menu. Foodini onboards restaurants to its platform using an accredited practicing dietitian who reviews and uploads all menus to the app. This helps ensure that the information is accurate and allows users to dine with some peace of mind. Importantly, it also contains information about restaurants cross-contamination capability, which is crucial for people with severe allergies.
